    - 🔑 Key: [model], [dataset], [planning], [reasoning], [Aguvis], [visual grounding]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces *Aguvis*, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. It leverages image-based observations and grounds natural language instructions to visual elements, employing a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. The approach integrates explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. A large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories is constructed, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. All datasets, models, and training recipes are open-sourced to facilitate future research.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual grounding], [GUI agents], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-V], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual grounding], [UI element localization], [LVG]
    - 📖 TLDR: This work introduces the task of visual UI grounding, which unifies detection and grounding by enabling models to identify UI elements referenced by natural language commands solely from visual input. The authors propose **LVG**, a model that outperforms baselines pre-trained on larger datasets by over 4.9 points in top-1 accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in localizing referenced UI elements without relying on UI metadata.

    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Env: [Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [visual prompting], [framework], [benchmark], [visual grounding], [zero-shot]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces Set-of-Mark (SoM), a novel visual prompting approach designed to enhance the visual grounding capabilities of multimodal models like GPT-4V. By overlaying images with spatially and semantically distinct marks, SoM enables fine-grained object recognition and interaction within visual data, surpassing conventional zero-shot segmentation methods in accuracy. The framework is validated on tasks requiring detailed spatial reasoning, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing visual-language models without fine-tuning.
